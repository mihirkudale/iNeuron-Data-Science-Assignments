    "#### 1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "**Ans:** Inheritence is nothing but reusing the code of Parent class by the child class. Similary when a child class inherits its properties from multiple Parent classes this scenario is called **Multiple Inheritence**. Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class."

    "**Ans:** Delegation provides a proxy object for any class that we want on top of the main class. It is like a wrapper to our class so that we can access limited resources of the main class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wraps the object of main class into a smaller object with limited access\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms,  Delegation means that we can include an instance of another class as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance."

Irrespective of inheritence, In this approach all the parent class members are not inherited into child class, but only required methods from a class are used by using class instances."

    "**Ans:** If a function is an attribute of class and it is accessed via the instances, they are called **bound methods**. A bound method is one that has **`self`** as its first argument. Since these are dependent on the instance of classes, these are also known as **instance methods**."

    "#### 5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "**Ans:** Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios\n",
