    "#### Q1. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`?\n",
    "**Ans:**  **`__getattribute__`** is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an **AttributeError** if it fails to find an attribute of a class. **`__getattr__`** is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by  **`__getattribute__`**, but for this **`__getattribute__`** and **`__getattr__`** both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, **`__getattr__`** returns a default value. So key difference is that **`__getattr__`** is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class. "

    "\n",
    "**Properties:** With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in property function or `@property` decorator. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access, but involes the appropriate function of the object.\n",

When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access but invokes an appropriate function of descriptor object."
