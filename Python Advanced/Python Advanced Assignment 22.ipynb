    "#### Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "**Ans:** Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name. In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements. Hence, there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays. This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and NumPy Arrays usually are much better alternatives. That’s also the reason why rarely people knows Python has a built-in Array type.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when something is restricted, it must bring some benefits. That is the so-call “trade-off”. In this case, Python Array will have a smaller size than Python List. This is demonstrated below."

    "**Ans:**  \n",
    "1. The number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance.An array is a static structure (which means the array is of fixed size). Once declared the size of the array cannot be modified. The memory which is allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Insertion and deletion are quite difficult in an array as the elements are stored in consecutive memory locations and the shifting operation is costly.\n",

If you try to write a function definition without any statement in python ,it will return an error. To avoid this, we use pass statement. pass is a special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement.  \n",

The dtype of any numpy array containing string values is the maximum length of any string present in the array.Once set, it will only be able to store new string having length not more than the maximum length at the time of the creation. If we try to reassign some another string value having length greater than the maximum length of the existing elements, it simply discards all the values beyond the maximum length accept upto those values which are under the limit."

    "**Ans:**  It will have same dimensionality as input array. Masking comes up when we want to extract, modify, count, or otherwise manipulate values in an array based on some criterion: for example, we might wish to count all values greater than a certain value, or perhaps remove all outliers that are above some threshold. In NumPy, Boolean masking is often the most efficient way to accomplish these types of tasks."
