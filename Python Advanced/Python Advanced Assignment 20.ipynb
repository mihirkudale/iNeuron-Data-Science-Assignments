    "#### 1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Both the `float` and `decimal` types store numerical values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `floats` when convenience and speed matter. A float gives us an approximation of the number we declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `decimals` when precision matters. `Decimals` can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, `decimals` are more precise than `floats`. The performance difference between `float` and `decimal`, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my experience, the precision benefits of a `decimal` outweigh the performance benefits of a `float`."

    "#### 2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Both values are same but internal representation at storage Is different. Precsion  differs, `Decimal('1.200')` gives internally  `1.200` and  `Decimal('1.2')` gives `1.2`."

    "**Ans:** Both values are checked to be equal since they only differ in precision."

    "#### 4. Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Floating-point value is converted to Decimal format. Decimal can store float value with absolute precision. But when float value is given as Decimal object,it first has to be converted from floating point value which might already have rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is preferable to start a Decimal object with a string."

    "#### 6. Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Arithmetic operfations like Adding,subtracting or multiplying a Decimal object by a floating-point value generates an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do these operations, the floating point has to be converted to a Decimal."
