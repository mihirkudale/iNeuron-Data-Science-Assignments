    "**Ans:** Security is the protection of assets from harm, while surveillance is the monitoring of people or property to detect activity that could be a threat. Security focuses on preventing and deterring threats, while surveillance is a proactive measure to detect potential threats. Surveillance is used to gather information to provide a higher level of security."
