    "**Ans:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly popular in banking, as it has the potential to streamline processes, improve customer service, and reduce costs. AI is used in a variety of applications such as fraud detection, customer service, marketing automation, and financial advice. AI can be used to analyze customer data to create personalized experiences, detect suspicious activities, and quickly respond to customer queries. AI can also be used to automate mundane tasks, allowing banks to focus their resources on more strategic activities. AI is also being used to automate loan processing and decision-making, which helps reduce processing time and costs. AI is also used to provide personalized investment advice to customers, as well as to analyze market data and trends to provide real-time insights for traders."

    "**Ans:** Insurance companies are using AI to help mitigate risk in a variety of ways. AI can be used to analyse customer data to detect suspicious patterns, such as fraudulent claims, or to assess the risk of a particular customer. AI can also be used to automate the process of underwriting to quickly price and issue policies, as well as to monitor customer behaviour for signs of changing risk profiles or policy lapses. AI can also be used in the claims process to detect fraudulent claims, automate the processing of claims, and create detailed reports to help adjusters quickly determine the validity of a claim. Finally, AI can be used to develop new products and services to better meet customer needs and reduce risk."
