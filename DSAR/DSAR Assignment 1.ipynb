    "**Ans:** AI applications in transportation include autonomous vehicles, intelligent traffic control systems, route optimization, fare estimation, predictive maintenance and safety, and driverless public transportation. Autonomous vehicles are the most popular application of AI in transportation, and they use advanced AI algorithms to detect objects, recognize signs, and make decisions. Intelligent traffic control systems leverage AI to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. Route optimization uses AI to help drivers and fleets find more efficient routes for faster and more cost-effective delivery. Fare estimation uses AI to predict the cost of a ride and adjust fares according to traffic and demand. Predictive maintenance and safety uses AI to detect potential problems and alert drivers to take action. Finally, driverless public transportation uses AI to provide people with a safe, reliable, and cost-effective way to get around."

    "**Ans:** One example of how AI is changing transportation is in autonomous vehicles. Autonomous cars are vehicles that are designed to operate without the need for a human driver. They use a combination of AI, sensors, and other technology to detect their environment and safely navigate roads and highways. Autonomous vehicles are being developed and tested by major car manufacturers, tech companies, and startups, and have the potential to revolutionize transportation by improving safety, reducing traffic congestion, and providing more efficient transportation solutions."

    "**Ans:** AI is helping transportation and logistics corporations in a variety of ways. AI can be used to optimize route planning, improve delivery times, reduce fuel costs, and increase customer satisfaction. It can also be used to automate processes such as document verification and processing, reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. Additionally, AI can be used to predict demand patterns, identify areas of risk, and detect fraud. AI can help companies improve their operations, increase their competitive advantage, and reduce their costs."

    "**Ans:** AI-powered robots can help in detecting oil leaks by using sensors to detect the presence of hydrocarbons in the environment. These sensors can detect even the smallest amounts of oil leaks and can alert operators in real-time so that they can take corrective action as soon as possible. AI-powered robots can also be used to inspect oil pipelines and tanks for potential leaks and to report any signs of potential problems."
