        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed for image classification tasks and offer several advantages over fully connected Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are more general-purpose models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some advantages of CNNs over DNNs for image classification:\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial Hierarchies: CNNs can capture spatial hierarchies by learning local patterns in an image and combining them to form higher-level representations. This is achieved through the use of convolutional layers, which apply filters to different parts of the image and learn to recognize specific features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameter Efficiency: CNNs are more parameter-efficient than DNNs, as they reuse the same set of weights across different parts of an image. This allows for faster training times and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Translation Invariance: CNNs are able to recognize objects in images regardless of their position or orientation, due to their ability to use the same filters across different parts of the image. This makes them more robust to variations in input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Extraction: CNNs can automatically learn and extract features from raw image data, which is not possible with DNNs. This reduces the need for manual feature engineering, which can be time-consuming and difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, CNNs are better suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies, parameter efficiency, translation invariance, and feature extraction capabilities."

        "**Ans:** Max pooling is a type of pooling operation commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks. The purpose of max pooling is to reduce the spatial size of the feature map and to make the model more robust to variations in the input image.\n",
        "\n",

        "One reason to use max pooling instead of a convolutional layer with the same stride is that max pooling can help reduce overfitting. By discarding some of the less important features in the feature map, max pooling forces the network to learn more robust and generalizable features. This can help prevent the network from memorizing the training data and performing poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

LRN layers apply a normalization function to the output of each neuron in a feature map, based on the responses of neighboring neurons within the same feature map.\n",

        "LRN layers are most commonly used in image recognition tasks, where they can help improve the accuracy of the network by reducing the impact of irrelevant features in the input image. Specifically, LRN layers are useful in situations where the input images contain a lot of noise or where there is significant variation in the lighting or color of the images.\n",
