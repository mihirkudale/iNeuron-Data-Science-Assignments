    "\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "Quick R-CNN is a variation of the Faster R-CNN architecture for object detection. It is an improved version of the R-CNN architecture which uses a single network to predict both the object's location and its class. Quick R-CNN uses a region proposal network (RPN) to generate candidate bounding boxes of potential objects in an image. These bounding boxes are then fed into a separate network to classify the objects and refine their locations. The RPN works by scanning a predefined set of anchor boxes across the image, and predicting a score for each one indicating how likely it is to contain an object of interest. The network then outputs a set of bounding boxes which are used as input to the second network. This second network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is responsible for predicting the class label of the object inside the bounding box, as well as refining the location of the box. The Quick R-CNN architecture is faster than the original R-CNN architecture due to the fact that it uses a single network to both generate and classify the bounding boxes."

It is a multi-class logistic regression loss that is used to update the weights of the network. This loss is based on the cross-entropy loss and penalizes incorrect classifications.\n",
