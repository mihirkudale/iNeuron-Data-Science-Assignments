    "**Ans:** The underlying concept of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two or more classes of data. By using a technique known as the kernel trick, SVMs are able to project data into higher-dimensional space to find a separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes of data. SVMs are powerful tools for classification, regression, outlier detection, and other machine learning tasks."

    "**Ans:** A support vector is a vector in a vector space that, when added to the data set, can help optimize the performance of a supervised learning algorithm. Support vectors are used in machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) and support vector regression (SVR). The concept of a support vector is to find a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, and the support vectors are the data points that are closest to it."

    "**Ans:** Scaling the inputs is necessary when using SVMs because the algorithm is sensitive to the relative size of the inputs. Without scaling, features with large values will dominate the optimization process and the model will not be able to accurately capture the underlying relationship between the features and the target. Scaling the inputs ensures that all features are given the same weight in the optimization process, allowing the model to capture more subtle patterns."

Generally, the dual form of the SVM problem is more efficient and can handle datasets with a large number of features and large number of instances better than the primal form. However, if the data set is too large or too complex, it might be better to use the primal form."

To do this, you will need to adjust the hyperparameters of each model, such as the regularization parameter C, the kernel type, and the margin width. You can also adjust other parameters such as the learning rate and the number of iterations. Once all of these parameters are tuned correctly, the models should produce similar results."
