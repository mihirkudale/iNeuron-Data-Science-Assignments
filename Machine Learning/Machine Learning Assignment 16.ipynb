    "**Ans:** Algebraically, a linear equation typically takes the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable. The slope tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average.\n",

In this simple linear regression, we are examining the impact of one independent variable on the outcome."
