    "**Ans:** The features in your data will directly influence the predictive models you use and the results you can achieve. Our results are dependent on many inter-dependent properties. We need great features that describe the structures inherent in your data. Better features means flexibility. The process of generating new variables (features) based on already existing variables is known as feature construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Construction is a useful process as it can add more information and give more insights of the data we are dealing with. It is done by transforming the numerical features into categorical features which is done while performing Binning. Also, feature construction is done by decomposing variables so that these new variables can be used in various machine learning algorithms such as the creation of Dummy Variables by performing Encoding. Other ways of constructing include deriving features from the pre-existing features and coming up with more meaningful features."

    "**Ans:** Nominal data is made of discrete values with no numerical relationship between the different categories —  mean and median are meaningless. Animal species is one example. For example, pig is not higher than bird and lower than fish. Ordinal or Label Encoding can be used to transform non-numerical labels into numerical labels (or nominal categorical variables). Numerical labels are always between 1 and the number of classes. The labels chosen for the categories have no relationship. So categories that have some ties or are close to each other lose such information after encoding. The first unique value in your column becomes 1, the second becomes 2, the third becomes 3, and so on."

    "**Ans:** Wrapper methods measure the “usefulness” of features based on the classifier performance.

    "\n",
    "1.**Forward selection**: In forward selection, we start with a null model and then start fitting the model with each individual feature one at a time and select the feature with the minimum p-value. Now fit a model with two features by trying combinations of the earlier selected feature with all other remaining features. Again select the feature with the minimum p-value. Now fit a model with three features by trying combinations of two previously selected features with other remaining features. Repeat this process until we have a set of selected features with a p-value of individual features less than the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Backward elimination**: In backward elimination, we start with the full model (including all the independent variables) and then remove the insignificant feature with the highest p-value(> significance level). This process repeats again and again until we have the final set of significant features\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Bi-directional elimination(Stepwise Selection):** It is similar to forward selection but the difference is while adding a new feature it also checks the significance of already added features and if it finds any of the already selected features insignificant then it simply removes that particular feature through backward elimination. Hence, It is a combination of forward selection and backward elimination.\n",

    "**Ans:** Feature selection is for filtering irrelevant or redundant features from your dataset. The key difference between feature selection and extraction is that feature selection keeps a subset of the original features while feature extraction creates brand new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, to improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Transformation is a technique by which we can boost our model performance. Feature transformation is a mathematical transformation in which we apply a mathematical formula to a particular column(feature) and transform the values which are useful for our further analysis. It is also known as Feature Engineering, which is creating new features from existing features that may help in improving the model performance. It refers to the family of algorithms that create new features using the existing features. These new features may not have the same interpretation as the original features, but they may have more explanatory power in a different space rather than in the original space. This can also be used for Feature Reduction. It can be done in many ways, by linear combinations of original features or by using non-linear functions. It helps machine learning algorithms to converge faster."
