    "- Get Data: The first step in the Machine Learning process is getting data.\n",

    "- Train Model: This step is where the magic happens!\n",
    "- Testing Model.\n",
    "- Improving model.\n",
    "- Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data to well-formed data sets so that data mining analytics can be applied. \n",
    "- Preprocessing involves both data validation and data imputation\n",
    "- The Goal of Data Validation is to assess whether the data in question is both complete and accurate.\n",
    "- The Goal of Data Imputation is to correct errors and input missing values, Either Manually or Automatically through business process automation (BPA) programming."

    "**Ans:** The following is a basic data collection that includes some sample records.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine What Information You Want to Collect:** The first thing you need to do is choose what details you want to collect. You’ll need to decide what topics the information will cover, who you want to collect it from and how much data you need. Your goals — what you hope to accomplish using your data — will determine your answers to these questions. As an example, you may decide to collect data about which type of articles are most popular on your website among visitors who are between the ages of 18 and 34. You might also choose to gather information about the average age of all of the customers who bought a product from your company within the last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set a Timeframe for Data Collection:** Next, you can start formulating your plan for how you’ll collect your data. In the early stages of your planning process, you should establish a timeframe for your data collection. You may want to gather some types of data continuously. When it comes to transactional data and website visitor data, for example, you may want to set up a method for tracking that data over the long term. If you’re tracking data for a specific  campaign, however, you’ll track it over a defined period. In these instances, you’ll have a schedule for when you’ll start and end your data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine Your Data Collection Method:** At this step, you will choose the data collection method that will make up  the core of your data-gathering strategy. To select the right collection method, you’ll need to consider the type of  information you want to collect, the timeframe over which you’ll obtain it and the other aspects you determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collect the Data:** Once you have finalized your plan, you can implement your data collection strategy and start collecting data. You can store and organize your data in your DMP. Be sure to stick to your plan and check on its progress regularly. It may be useful to create a schedule for when you will check in with how your data collection is proceeding, especially if you are collecting data continuously. You may want to make updates to your plan as conditions change and you get new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analyze the Data and Implement Your Findings:** Once you’ve collected all of your data, it’s time to analyze it and organize your findings. The analysis phase is crucial because it turns raw data into valuable insights that you can use to enhance your marketing strategies, products and business decisions. You can use the analytics tools built into our DMP to help with this step. Once you’ve uncovered the patterns and insights in your data, you can implement the findings to improve your business."

The popular methods which are used by the machine learning community to handle the missing value for categorical variables in the dataset are as follows: Delete the observations: If there is a large number of observations in the dataset, where all the classes to be predicted are sufficiently represented in the training data, then try deleting the missing value observations, which would not bring significant change in your feed to your model."

    "**Ans:** The Various Data Pre-Processing Techniques are:\n",
    "-  **Data Cleaning:**  The data can have many irrelevant and missing parts. To handle this part, data cleaning is done. It  involves handling of missing data, noisy data etc.  \n",
    "    - **Missing Data:**  This situation arises when some data is missing in the data. It can be handled in various ways.  Some of them are: \n",
    "        - **Ignore the tuples:**  This approach is suitable only when the dataset we have is quite large and multiple values are missing within a tuple.  \n",
    "        - **Fill the Missing values:** There are various ways to do this task. You can choose to fill the missing values manually, by attribute mean or the most probable value.\n",
    "    - **Noisy Data:** Noisy data is a meaningless data that can’t be interpreted by machines.It can be generated due to  faulty data collection, data entry errors etc. It can be handled in following ways : \n",
    "        - **Binning Method:** This method works on sorted data in order to smooth it. The whole data is divided into segments of equal size and then various methods are performed to complete  the task. Each segmented is handled separately. One can replace all data in a  segment by its mean or boundary values can be used to complete the task.  \n",
    "        - **Regression:** Here data can be made smooth by fitting it to a regression function.The regression used may be linear (having one independent variable) or multiple (having multiple  independent variables). \n",
    "        - **Clustering:** This approach groups the similar data in a cluster. The outliers may be undetected or it will fall outside the clusters. \n",
    "        \n",
    "     \n",
    "-  **Data Reduction:**  Since data mining is a technique that is used to handle huge amount of data. While working with  huge volume of data, analysis became harder in such cases. In order to get rid of this, we uses data  reduction technique. It aims to increase the storage efficiency and reduce data storage and analysis costs. The various steps to data reduction are: \n",
    "    - **Data Cube Aggregation:** Aggregation operation is applied to data for the construction of the data cube.  \n",
    "    - **Attribute Subset Selection:** The highly relevant attributes should be used, rest all can be discarded. For performing  attribute selection, one can use level of significance and p- value of the attribute.the attribute  having p-value greater than significance level can be discarded. \n",
    "    - **Numerosity Reduction:** This enable to store the model of data instead of whole data, for example: Regression Models. \n",
    "    - **Dimensionality Reduction:** This reduce the size of data by encoding mechanisms.It can be lossy or lossless. If after reconstruction from compressed data, original data can be retrieved, such reduction are called lossless reduction else it is called lossy reduction. The two effective methods of dimensionality reduction are:Wavelet transforms and PCA (Principal Component Analysis). \n",

    "    - An example of interval data is the data collected on a  thermometer—its gradation or markings are equidistant. \n",

    "- **The average and median:** \n",
    "    - The mean (informally, the “average“) is found by adding all of the numbers together and dividing  by the number of items in the set: 10 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 70 / 5 = 30. The median is found by ordering  the set from lowest to highest and finding the exact middle. The median is just the middle number:  20\n",

    "    - Histograms and box plots are very similar in that they both help to visualize and describe numeric data. Although histograms are better in determining the underlying distribution of the data, box plots allow you to compare multiple data sets better than histograms as they are less detailed and take up less space.\n",
