It is one of the simplest ML algorithms that can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection, Diabetes prediction, cancer detection etc.\n",

The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random forest:** Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression. It performs better results for classification problems.\n",

    "- **XGBoost:** XGBoost is an algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions for structured or tabular data. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.Why XGBoost must be a part of your machine learning toolkit.\n",
