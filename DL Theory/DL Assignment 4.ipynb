    "**Ans:** While TensorFlow includes a subset of NumPy's functionality, it is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy. NumPy is primarily focused on numerical computing and provides a powerful N-dimensional array object, while TensorFlow is focused on machine learning and provides operations on tensors, which are similar to NumPy's arrays but with additional features for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between NumPy and TensorFlow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Graphs:** TensorFlow uses a computational graph to represent operations, allowing for efficient distributed computing and automatic differentiation for backpropagation, while NumPy does not have this capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GPU Acceleration:** TensorFlow supports GPU acceleration for neural network computations, which can significantly speed up training times compared to NumPy, which primarily uses the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Processing:** While both libraries can process numerical data, TensorFlow has built-in features specifically for data preprocessing and data augmentation for machine learning tasks, which NumPy does not have.\n",

    "**Ans:** In TensorFlow Keras, custom components such as layers, models, loss functions, and metrics can contain arbitrary Python code, but they must be convertible to TensorFlow Functions in order to be used in a computational graph. TensorFlow Functions are a special type of callable that can be traced by TensorFlow's autograph system, allowing them to be used in accelerated computational graphs for improved performance.\n",

    "4. `Avoid Assigning to Variables`: TensorFlow Functions are stateless, meaning that they should not contain any assignments to variables or other stateful operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Avoid Non-Deterministic Operations`: TensorFlow Functions should only contain deterministic operations, meaning that the output should always be the same given the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Use Specialized TensorFlow Functions`: When possible, you should use specialized TensorFlow Functions such as `tf.nn` and `tf.math` to perform common operations, as these functions are optimized for performance and compatibility with TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Annotate with @tf.function`: To ensure that a Python function can be converted to a TensorFlow Function, you should annotate it with the `@tf.function` decorator, which will convert the function to a TensorFlow Function and ensure that it is compatible with TensorFlow's autograph system.\n",

    "2. When dealing with images or other data types where the dimensions of the input may vary, such as using data augmentation techniques.\n",
    "3. When using certain types of advanced architectures, such as attention mechanisms or recursive neural networks.\n",
    "In order to create a dynamic Keras model, you need to specify the input shape of your model as `None` for any dimensions that may vary in size. For example, if you were working with sequences of text data, you could define a dynamic Keras model as follows:\n",

    "`model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)`\n",

    "It is not always necessary or desirable to make all models dynamic, as there can be some performance benefits to using static models with fixed input and output shapes. Static models can be optimized more effectively by the TensorFlow compiler, and can take advantage of hardware-specific optimizations such as fused operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in cases where you need to work with variable-length or dynamically shaped data, or when using certain types of advanced architectures, a dynamic Keras model may be necessary to achieve the desired results.
