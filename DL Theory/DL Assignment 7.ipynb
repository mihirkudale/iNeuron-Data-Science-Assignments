This can be addressed by using techniques such as gradient clipping, weight initialization, and using gated RNN variants like LSTMs and GRUs.\n",

        "\n",
        "* `Difficulty in parallelization`: Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs are difficult to parallelize due to their sequential nature. This can result in slow training times, especially for large sequences. One way to handle this is to use techniques such as truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT) and bucketing to reduce the length of the sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Input normalization`: RNNs are sensitive to the scale of the input features, and normalization can help improve their performance. Standard normalization techniques such as min-max scaling and z-score normalization can be used.\n",

        "* `Choosing hyperparameters`: RNNs have several hyperparameters such as the number of layers, hidden units, learning rate, and batch size that need to be tuned carefully. Techniques such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization can be used to find optimal hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "To handle these difficulties, it is important to experiment with different architectures, regularization techniques, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameters to find the best combination for the given problem. It is also important to monitor the training process carefully, visualize the results, and make adjustments as necessary. Additionally, using pre-trained models or transfer learning can help to overcome some of these difficulties."
