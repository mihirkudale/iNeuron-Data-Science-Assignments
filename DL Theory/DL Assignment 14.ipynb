    "**Ans:** Yes, it is okay to initialize all the weights to the same value as long as that value is selected randomly using He initialization. He initialization is a specific type of random initialization technique that ensures that the weights are initialized with a good balance of small and large values, which helps to optimize the learning process."

    "**Ans:** If the momentum hyperparameter is set too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999), the model may not be able to make any updates to the weights during the training process as the gradients will be too small. This can lead to poor model performance and longer training times."
